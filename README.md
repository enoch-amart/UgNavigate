        // Heavy traffic near academic buildings
    case EVENING_RUSH:
        // Heavy traffic near residential areas
    case NORMAL_HOURS:
        // Standard traffic conditions
}
```

enum LandmarkType {
    ENTRANCE, ACADEMIC, RESIDENTIAL, 
    DINING, RECREATION, SERVICES, 
    ADMINISTRATIVE, GENERAL
}
```

### Traffic Conditions
```java
enum TrafficCondition {
    LIGHT(1.0, 1.0),      // No traffic penalty
    MODERATE(1.2, 1.3),   // 20% distance, 30% time penalty
    HEAVY(1.5, 1.8)       // 50% distance, 80% time penalty
}
